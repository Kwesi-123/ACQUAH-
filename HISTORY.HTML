<h2>Briefy history of lion</h2>
 <a href="#Adult female lion">Average height of a lion</a>

<p>Lions once lived in southern Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia.<br></br> Today, however, they are confined mainly to the game reserves of Africa. A few live in the Gir Forest of India. This Indian subspecies is highly endangered: a single disease outbreak could wipe them all out.

<p>An adult male lion can be 3.4 m (11 ft.) long including the tail, and weigh as much as 250 kg (550 lb.).</p><br><br> The female is about 15 to 20% smaller, and lacks the male's heavy mane.

Most lions, except non-breeding males, live in groups known as prides, which usually include 6 to 30 members.<br><p>One or two mature males, or occasionally more, will reside with each pride.</p>,<br>

Typically, lions spend 20 to 21 hours per day resting.,<br></br> <p>The remaining time is spent interacting socially (playing, nursing, mating, loafing, etcetera) and hunting.</p><br>

<p>Lions prey mostly on hoofed animals, although they occasionally consume fallen fruit and carrion.</p><br><p id="Adult female lion"><strong> They hunt co-operatively and, while the females are better hunters and do most of the work bringing down the prey, </p><br>the males eat first, followed by the females, and then the cubs. The initial charge of a hunting lion only lasts about 50 to 100 m (164 to 328 ft.).</p> If the intended prey is quick enough to keep ahead of the predator for that distance, the lion will usually abandon the attempt.</strong></p>
